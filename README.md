This is a game I made within Unity Engine (C#) to see if I'd enjoy participating in these 'Ludum Dare game-jams' that come along. With that in mind, I kept the development time I had for this game very minimal and just tried to whip up something playable. The premise of the game is silly and the idea came solely from being hyped for Drake's new album - ["Views From The 6"](http://www.fuse.tv/2016/02/drake-views-from-the-6-album-guide-songs-tracklist).
